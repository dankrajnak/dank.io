This is my personal website.  It's not live yet.  I'm still tweaking things and getting it ready.  The idea is that it
will be a place for me to put the web projects I've created that I think are interesting and worth showing.  It's 
also a bit of an experiment in itself as I try out new technologies I think are neat.

Stay tuned for more.

### Running a development version of the site
After downloading this repository, cd into the repository and run 
```bash
